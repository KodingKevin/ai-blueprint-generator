# ai-blueprint-generator
For this project I will make a model that generates blueprint-style floor plans for restaurant buildings using constraint-based layout algorithms and AI-assisted
natural language parsing.

## How to Run
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py

## Output
The program generates a vector-based SVG blueprint that can be viewed
in any modern web browser.
